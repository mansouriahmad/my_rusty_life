- Rust language is to some extent designed around its types! 

- Rust's memory and thread safety comes from the soundness of its type systems

- Although Rust doesn't promise it will represent things exactly as you've requested, it takes care to deviate from your request only when it's a reliable improvement.

**What does it mean: Rust lets you leave out or *elide*?**

Look at the code below:

```rust
fn build_vector() -> Vec<i16> {
    let mut v : Vec<i16> = Vec::<i16>::new();
    v.push(10i16);
    v.push(20i16);
    v
}
```

The issue is that the code is cluttered and repetitive. Since the function's return type is Vec<i16>, ***V*** should be a Vec<16>. From that, it follows that each element of the vector should be an `i16`. This is exactly the type of reasoning Rust's type inference applies, allowing the programmer to instead write:



```rust
fn build_vector() -> Vec<i16> {
    let mut v  = Vec::new();
    v.push(10);
    v.push(20);
    v
}
```

**Note:**
- Rust will generate the same machien code either way!
- Type inference gives back much of the legibility of dynamically types languages, while still catching errors at compile time!


**Note:**
- Rust's generic functions give the language a degree of the same flexibilty as ***duck typing** in Python, while still catching all type errors at compile time.


**Imporant:** Generic functions are just as efficient as their nongeneric counterparts:
- There is not inherent perforamnce advantage to be had from writing a specific `sum` function for each integer over writing a generic one that handles all integers.

**What is the difference between Unicode and utf-8:**

#### üî§ Unicode

**Unicode** is a *character set*. It defines a universal standard for **what characters exist** and assigns each one a unique **code point**.

Examples:
- `'A'` ‚Üí `U+0041`
- `'‚Ç¨'` ‚Üí `U+20AC`
- `'üòÄ'` ‚Üí `U+1F600`

Think of Unicode as a big **dictionary** of all characters from all languages, emojis, symbols, etc.

#### üß© UTF-8

**UTF-8** stands for *Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bit*. It is a **character encoding** ‚Äî it defines how to store or transmit Unicode characters using **bytes**.

Examples:
- `'A'` ‚Üí Unicode: `U+0041` ‚Üí UTF-8: `0x41` (1 byte)
- `'‚Ç¨'` ‚Üí Unicode: `U+20AC` ‚Üí UTF-8: `0xE2 0x82 0xAC` (3 bytes)
